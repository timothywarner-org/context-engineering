# Port Management Fixes

## Problem Summary

The CoreText MCP server had two port-related issues:

1. **Port 3000 conflicts**: The health server used port 3000, which conflicted with MCP Inspector's backend server
2. **Stale processes**: Previous crashes left Node.js processes holding ports 3000 and 5173, preventing clean restarts

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Port Allocation Changes

**Before:**
- Health server: Port 3000 (conflicted with Inspector)
- MCP Inspector backend: Port 3000
- MCP Inspector UI: Port 5173

**After:**
- Health server: Port 3001 (configurable via `HEALTH_PORT` env var)
- MCP Inspector backend: Port 3000
- MCP Inspector UI: Port 5173

### 2. Automatic Port Cleanup

Added three mechanisms for port cleanup:

#### A. Server Startup Cleanup (`src/index.js`)
- Automatically kills processes on ports 3000, 5173, and 3001 when starting
- Uses Windows `netstat` and `taskkill` commands
- Runs before health server initialization

#### B. Standalone Kill Script (`scripts/kill-ports.js`)
- Manually clean ports with `npm run kill-ports`
- Useful for troubleshooting before running inspector
- Shows detailed status for each port

#### C. Inspector Script Enhancement
- Updated `npm run inspector` to automatically run `kill-ports` first
- Ensures clean state every time inspector starts

## Files Modified

### `src/index.js`
1. Added imports for `exec` and `promisify`
2. Added `killPort()` function (lines 46-85)
3. Updated `start()` method to kill ports before health server (lines 1137-1142)
4. Changed health server port from 3000 to 3001 (line 1166)

### `package.json`
- Added `kill-ports` script
- Updated `inspector` script to run `kill-ports` before starting

### New Files
- `scripts/kill-ports.js`: Standalone port cleanup utility

## Usage

### Start MCP Inspector (Recommended)
```bash
npm run inspector
```
This automatically:
1. Cleans ports 3000, 5173, 3001
2. Starts MCP Inspector UI at http://localhost:5173
3. Starts CoreText server with health endpoint at http://localhost:3001/health

### Manual Port Cleanup
```bash
npm run kill-ports
```

### Start Server Only
```bash
npm start
# Health endpoint: http://localhost:3001/health
```

## Port Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Override health server port (default: 3001)
HEALTH_PORT=3002 npm start

# Azure deployment can also use PORT for container apps
PORT=8080 npm start  # Health server will use 3001
HEALTH_PORT=8081 npm start  # Override health port specifically
```

## Testing

### Verify Port Cleanup
```bash
# Before fix: Would show errors about EADDRINUSE
# After fix: Should start cleanly

npm run inspector
# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ Port 3000 is free
# ‚úÖ Port 5173 is free
# ‚úÖ Port 3001 is free
# üîç MCP Inspector is up and running at http://localhost:5173
```

### Verify Health Endpoint
```bash
npm start
# Then in another terminal:
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Expected response:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "timestamp": "2025-10-30T...",
#   "memoryCount": 3,
#   "enrichmentConfigured": true,
#   "uptime": 12.34
# }
```

## Troubleshooting

### Inspector Still Won't Start

1. Manually check for processes:
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
```

2. Kill all Node processes (nuclear option):
```bash
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
```

3. Try starting fresh:
```bash
npm run kill-ports
npm run inspector
```

### Health Server Port Still in Use

Check what's using port 3001:
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
```

Override with different port:
```bash
HEALTH_PORT=3002 npm start
```

## Benefits

1. **No manual intervention**: Inspector starts cleanly every time
2. **Better development experience**: No need to manually kill processes
3. **Production ready**: Health server on different port prevents conflicts
4. **Configurable**: Environment variables for custom port assignments
5. **Debugging friendly**: Clear console output shows port status

## Azure Container Apps Compatibility

The health endpoint port change (3000 ‚Üí 3001) doesn't affect Azure deployment:
- Azure Container Apps typically use port 80/443 externally
- Internal health checks can target any port
- Update `docker-compose.yml` or container app config if needed:

```yaml
# Container Apps health probe
healthProbes:
  - type: readiness
    httpGet:
      path: /health
      port: 3001
```

## Teaching Notes

This fix demonstrates:
1. Port conflict resolution strategies
2. Process management in Node.js
3. Graceful degradation (fallback port cleanup)
4. Development vs production port allocation
5. Windows command-line process management
