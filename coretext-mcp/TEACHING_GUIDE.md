# üìö CORETEXT MCP SERVER - COMPLETE TEACHING GUIDE

## üéØ CORE TEACHING OBJECTIVES

1. **The Problem**: AI has amnesia - forgets everything between sessions
2. **The Solution**: MCP provides persistent context via tools and resources  
3. **The Implementation**: CRUD operations, memory types, enrichment
4. **The Production Path**: Local JSON ‚Üí Azure Container Apps ‚Üí Cosmos DB

---

## üöÄ DEMO FLOW (4 SEGMENTS)

### SEGMENT 1: FROM PROMPTS TO PERSISTENT CONTEXT (55 min)

#### Demo 1: The Amnesia Problem (10 min)

```bash
# Show ChatGPT forgetting
ChatGPT: "Remember my favorite color is blue"
[New Session]
ChatGPT: "What's my favorite color?"
‚Üí It doesn't know!
```

**TEACHING POINT**: Context windows are temporary. Tokens are expensive. Copy-paste doesn't scale.

#### Demo 2: Deploy CoreText MCP (10 min)

```bash
cd C:\github\coretext-mcp
npm install
npm run inspector

# Show the tool list in Inspector
# Point out the 8 tools and 3 resources
```

**TEACHING POINT**: MCP is a universal protocol. Works with Claude, ChatGPT (via plugins), Copilot.

#### Demo 3: Create Your First Memory (10 min)

```javascript
// In MCP Inspector, call memory_create
{
  "content": "Tim prefers dark themes and uses VS Code with Monokai Pro",
  "type": "semantic",
  "tags": ["preferences", "tim", "vscode"],
  "enrich": false  // Start without enrichment
}

// Response shows:
// - Unique ID generated
// - Metadata with timestamps
// - Ready for persistence
```

**TEACHING POINT**: Semantic memory = facts. Episodic memory = events.

#### Demo 4: Prove Persistence (10 min)

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Restart it
npm run inspector

# Call memory_list
‚Üí Memory is still there!

# Show the JSON file
cat data/memory.json
```

**TEACHING POINT**: Context survives restarts. This is the "aha!" moment.

#### Exercise 1: Students Create Memories (10 min)

Have students create:

- One semantic memory (a fact)
- One episodic memory (an event)
- Search for their memories

---

### SEGMENT 2: BUILDING YOUR CONTEXT STACK (55 min)

#### Demo 5: The Two Memory Types (15 min)

```javascript
// Create episodic memory
{
  "content": "Had breakthrough discussion about MCP authentication at 2:15pm with the team",
  "type": "episodic",
  "tags": ["meeting", "mcp", "authentication", "team"],
  "enrich": false
}

// Create related semantic memory
{
  "content": "MCP authentication uses API keys stored in environment variables for security",
  "type": "semantic", 
  "tags": ["mcp", "authentication", "security", "api"],
  "enrich": false
}

// Call memory_stats
‚Üí Shows breakdown of memory types
```

**TEACHING POINT**: Episodic = timeline, Semantic = knowledge base. Humans use both!

#### Demo 6: Search and Discovery (10 min)

```javascript
// Search for "authentication"
{
  "query": "authentication",
  "limit": 10
}
‚Üí Returns both memories!

// Search for "meeting"
{
  "query": "meeting",
  "limit": 10  
}
‚Üí Returns only episodic memory
```

**TEACHING POINT**: Tags and content are both searchable. This is how AI finds relevant context.

#### Demo 7: Enrichment with Deepseek (15 min)

```javascript
// Create and enrich in one step
{
  "content": "Azure Container Apps provides serverless containers with automatic scaling and built-in KEDA support",
  "type": "semantic",
  "tags": ["azure", "containers", "serverless"],
  "enrich": true  // NOW we enrich!
}

// Response shows:
// - Keywords extracted
// - Sentiment analyzed
// - Category identified
// - Summary generated

// Or enrich existing memory
{
  "id": "existing-memory-id"
}
// Call memory_enrich tool
```

**TEACHING POINT**: Enrichment adds AI analysis. Works WITH key (Deepseek) or WITHOUT (fallback).

#### Demo 8: Resource Access (10 min)

```javascript
// Access the overview resource
Read resource: memory://overview

‚Üí Shows markdown dashboard with:
  - Statistics
  - Recent activity
  - Most accessed memories
  - Tag cloud

// Access the context stream
Read resource: memory://context-stream

‚Üí Shows JSON with:
  - Recent memories (last hour)
  - Today's context
  - Active topics
```

**TEACHING POINT**: Resources are always available. AI doesn't need to call tools to see them.

---

### SEGMENT 3: ADVANCED PATTERNS - MULTI-AGENT MEMORY (55 min)

#### Demo 9: The Knowledge Graph (15 min)

```javascript
// Create interconnected memories
1. "MCP enables persistent context for AI assistants"
   tags: ["mcp", "context", "ai"]

2. "Context persistence solves the token window limitation"
   tags: ["context", "tokens", "limitation"]

3. "AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT benefit from MCP"
   tags: ["ai", "claude", "chatgpt", "mcp"]

// Access knowledge graph
Read resource: memory://knowledge-graph

‚Üí Shows:
  - Nodes (memories)
  - Edges (connections via shared tags)
  - Clusters (groups of related memories)
  - Connection strength
```

**TEACHING POINT**: Memories don't exist in isolation. They form semantic networks!

#### Demo 10: Context Stream in Action (15 min)

```javascript
// Rapid-fire memory creation to show stream
- Create 5 memories quickly
- Access memory://context-stream after each

‚Üí Watch as memories move through:
  - recentContext (< 1 hour)
  - todayContext (< 24 hours)
  - earlierContext (older)
```

**TEACHING POINT**: Working memory (recent) vs long-term memory (earlier). Just like human cognition!

#### Demo 11: CRUD Operations Deep Dive (10 min)

```javascript
// Full CRUD cycle
1. CREATE: memory_create
2. READ: memory_read with ID
3. UPDATE: memory_update to change content
4. DELETE: memory_delete to remove

// Show how metadata tracks everything:
- created timestamp
- updated timestamp
- accessCount increments
- lastAccessed updates
```

**TEACHING POINT**: Every operation is tracked. This enables analytics and optimization.

#### Demo 12: Multi-Agent Scenario (10 min)

```
Scenario: Customer Service + Technical Support

1. Customer Service Agent creates:
   "Customer reported login issues with error code 403"
   type: episodic, tags: ["customer", "login", "error"]

2. Technical Support Agent searches:
   query: "error 403"
   ‚Üí Finds the customer service memory

3. Technical Support creates:
   "Error 403 is caused by expired authentication tokens"
   type: semantic, tags: ["error", "authentication", "solution"]

4. Knowledge graph shows connection!
```

**TEACHING POINT**: Different agents share the same memory pool. Context flows between them!

---

### SEGMENT 4: PRODUCTION REALITY (45 min)

#### Demo 13: Security Patterns (10 min)

```bash
# Show authentication hierarchy
1. System environment variable (most secure)
   echo $DEEPSEEK_API_KEY

2. .env file (development)
   cat .env

3. Config file (demo only)
   cat claude_desktop_config.json

4. Never hardcode!
```

**TEACHING POINT**: API keys follow hierarchy. Production uses Azure Key Vault.

#### Demo 14: Azure Deployment Path (10 min)

```bash
# Show Docker setup
cat Dockerfile

# Explain migration path:
1. Current: JSON file (data/memory.json)
2. Next: Azure Cosmos DB
3. Future: Azure AI Search (vectors)

# Show where to modify:
- MemoryManager class
- Replace file operations with Cosmos SDK
- Add connection string from Key Vault
```

**TEACHING POINT**: Architecture is cloud-ready. Minimal changes for production.

#### Demo 15: Performance & Scale (10 min)

```javascript
// Show stats
memory_stats

// Discuss metrics:
- Memory operations: < 10ms (local)
- Search latency: < 50ms
- Storage: 100MB JSON limit
- Cosmos DB: Unlimited scale
- Vector search: Semantic similarity

// Cost considerations:
- Tokens saved by not repeating context
- API calls reduced via caching
- Enrichment on-demand vs automatic
```

**TEACHING POINT**: MCP saves money by reducing token usage. Context is cached, not repeated.

#### Demo 16: Real-World Integration (10 min)

```json
// Show Claude Desktop config
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coretext": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\github\\coretext-mcp\\src\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}

// Explain integration points:
- Claude: Native MCP support
- ChatGPT: Via plugins/actions
- Copilot: Through extensions
- Custom apps: MCP SDK
```

**TEACHING POINT**: MCP is becoming the standard. Early adoption = competitive advantage.

## üéì KEY TEACHING MOMENTS

### The "Aha!" Moments

1. **Persistence Demo**: Stop/start server, memory survives
2. **Knowledge Graph**: See memories connect automatically
3. **Context Stream**: Watch conversation continuity in real-time
4. **Enrichment**: AI analyzes and categorizes memories

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not just use a database directly?**
A: MCP provides a standard interface that works across AI tools. It's the protocol layer.

**Q: How is this different from RAG?**
A: RAG retrieves documents. MCP manages structured context with CRUD operations.

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: Local deployment, encrypted storage, API key management, RBAC ready.

**Q: Can this scale?**
A: Yes! Cosmos DB for storage, Container Apps for compute, AI Search for vectors.

### Troubleshooting Tips

1. **"Cannot find module"**
   - Run `npm install`
   - Check Node version (>=18)

2. **"API key not found"**
   - Check environment variable: `echo $DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
   - Fallback mode still works!

3. **"Memory not persisting"**
   - Check data/memory.json exists
   - Verify write permissions

4. **"Inspector not working"**
   - Update to latest: `npm update @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
   - Try direct start: `node src/index.js`
