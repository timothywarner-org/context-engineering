## üöÄ Quick Start for Presenters

### 1. Print the Quick Reference Card

```bash
# Open in browser and print
code DEMO_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
# File ‚Üí Print ‚Üí Save as PDF or print to paper
```

Keep this card visible during the live demo for quick command lookup.

### 2. Review the Full Demo Script

```bash
code DEMO_SCRIPT.md
```

Read through once before the demo to familiarize yourself with:
- Timing for each section
- Code sections to highlight
- Expected outputs
- Talking points

### 3. Complete Pre-Demo Checklist

From DEMO_SCRIPT.md:
- [ ] 5 terminals open and positioned
- [ ] Azure CLI authenticated (`az account show`)
- [ ] Environment variables set (`$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`)
- [ ] Git repos clean (`git status`)
- [ ] Browser tabs ready (Azure Portal, MCP spec, diagrams)
- [ ] Claude Desktop config backed up
- [ ] Screen sharing tested

### 4. Test Run (Optional but Recommended)

Do a quick 15-minute test run:

```bash
# Part 1 test: CoreText Inspector
cd coretext-mcp && npm run inspector
# Create 1 memory, verify in UI

# Part 2 test: Stoic Inspector
cd stoic-mcp/local && npm run build
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
# Get 1 random quote, verify in UI

# Part 3 test: Claude Desktop
# Open Claude Desktop, verify 2 servers connected

# Part 4 test: Azure CLI
az account show
# Verify authenticated and correct subscription
```

## üé¨ Presentation Tips

### Before Starting

**Set Expectations**:
> "Today we'll build two complete MCP servers from scratch, test them locally, configure them in Claude Desktop, and deploy one to Azure. You'll leave with working code, architecture diagrams, and production deployment templates."

**Share Repository**:
> "All code and documentation is in this GitHub repo. You can clone it now or wait until after the demo. Everything we do today is reproducible on your machines."

### During the Demo

**Be Verbal About What You're Doing**:
- "Now I'm switching to terminal 2..."
- "I'm going to scroll to line 150 where the enrichment happens..."
- "Watch the Inspector UI on the right as I call this tool..."

**Explain Waiting Periods**:
- Docker build: "This takes 2-3 minutes, let me explain what's happening..."
- Azure deployment: "While this provisions, let's look at the Bicep template..."
- API calls: "DeepSeek is thinking... this typically takes 1-2 seconds..."

**Use the Diagrams**:
- Switch to diagram when explaining architecture
- Point out specific components: "This box here is the MemoryManager..."
- Use diagrams during deployment waiting periods

**Handle Errors Gracefully**:
- "Ah, port already in use - let me kill that process..."
- "This is a good teaching moment about..."
- Use DEMO_QUICK_REFERENCE.md troubleshooting section

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't assume everything is installed**
   - Verify Node.js version at start
   - Check Azure CLI authentication early
   - Test screen sharing before starting

2. **Don't skip the 'why'**
   - Explain WHY we use MCP (context persistence)
   - Explain WHY managed identity (no credentials in code)
   - Explain WHY scale-to-zero (cost optimization)

3. **Don't rush through code**
   - Students need time to understand
   - Highlight key lines slowly
   - Pause for questions after each section

4. **Don't forget to demo the "win"**
   - Show context persisting across Claude restarts
   - Show auto-scaling in Azure
   - Show cost being low

## üêõ Troubleshooting During Live Demo

### If Something Breaks...

**Keep Calm and Use Backups**:

1. **MCP Inspector won't start**
   ‚Üí Use test-client.js instead
   ‚Üí Or skip Inspector, show Claude Desktop directly

2. **Docker build fails**
   ‚Üí Use pre-built image from Docker Hub
   ‚Üí Or skip Docker, focus on Bicep template walkthrough

3. **Azure deployment takes forever**
   ‚Üí Show already-deployed instance in different resource group
   ‚Üí Explain what would happen while showing portal

4. **Network/internet fails**
   ‚Üí Switch to local-only demos (Parts 1-3)
   ‚Üí Show pre-recorded video of Azure deployment
   ‚Üí Share deployment script for students to try later

5. **Forgot a command**
   ‚Üí Check DEMO_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (print it!)
   ‚Üí Or check DEMO_SCRIPT.md on second monitor

**Remember**: Technical difficulties happen. How you handle them teaches professionalism!
