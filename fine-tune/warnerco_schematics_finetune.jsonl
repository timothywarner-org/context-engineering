What components should I check?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"For inconsistent weld quality on the Vulcan Welder (WC-700), check these components in order of likelihood:\n\n1. **Wire feed mechanism** (WRN-00023, v2.1): Inconsistent wire feed is the most common cause of weld quality issues. Verify the wire speed is within the 1-25 m/min range and holding 1% accuracy. Check for wire slippage, worn drive rollers, or liner blockages. Ensure the wire diameter (0.6-1.6mm) matches your configured setting.\n\n2. **Arc welding head assembly** (WRN-00011, v1.5): Check that the adaptive seam tracking is functioning at 0.1mm accuracy. Verify current output stability across the 5-500A range. If the issue is process-specific, isolate whether it occurs in MIG, TIG, or spot mode.\n\n3. **Fume extraction system** (WRN-00015, v1.2): Though less obvious, reduced extraction flow (rated 2000 m3/h) can affect shielding gas coverage, leading to porosity. Check filter condition - at 99.97% efficiency rating, a clogged filter will reduce flow significantly.\n\nStart with a wire feed calibration test, then move to arc stability diagnostics if the feed checks out."}]}
