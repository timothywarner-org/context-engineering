const server = new Server({
  name: 'github-context-server',
  version: '1.0.0'
}, {
  capabilities: {
    tools: {},
    resources: {}
  }
});

// Implement tools for repo access, file reading, commit history
server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => ({
  tools: [
    {
      name: 'read_repo_file',
      description: 'Read a file from a GitHub repository',
      inputSchema: {
        type: 'object',

          path: { type: 'string' }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}));
```

```

**Architecture:**
```
Claude Desktop → HTTPS → Azure App Service (MCP Server)
                              ↓
                        Azure Key Vault (secrets)
                              ↓
                        Azure Cosmos DB (memory store)
                              ↓
                        Application Insights (monitoring)
```

**Exercise:** Deploy your GitHub MCP server to Azure and connect Claude Desktop to the remote endpoint (10 min)

**Key Takeaways:**

---

### Segment 4: Advanced Patterns - Multi-Agent Memory Architectures (50 minutes)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Design memory architectures: episodic, semantic, and working memory
- Implement vector-based semantic search with Azure AI Search
- Orchestrate multiple AI agents sharing context through MCP
- Build a production customer service bot with persistent memory

**Topics Covered:**
- Memory architecture patterns in AI systems
- Vector databases: embeddings and similarity search
- Multi-agent orchestration: ChatGPT ↔ Claude via shared MCP context
- Context compression and pruning strategies
- Cost optimization and caching techniques

**Live Build: Customer Service Bot**
```typescript
// Multi-agent memory system
class CustomerServiceMemory {
  episodic: ConversationHistory[];  // What happened
  semantic: VectorStore;             // What it means
  working: CurrentContext;           // Active task state

  async retrieveRelevantContext(query: string) {
    // 1. Semantic search for similar past conversations
    const similar = await this.semantic.search(query, k=5);

    // 2. Retrieve recent episodic memory
    const recent = this.episodic.slice(-10);

    // 3. Combine with working memory
    return this.compress({
      similar,
      recent,
      working: this.working
    });
  }
}
```

**Architecture Patterns:**
1. **Episodic Memory**: Time-ordered conversation storage
2. **Semantic Memory**: Vector embeddings for similarity retrieval
3. **Working Memory**: Current task context (4K tokens)
4. **Long-term Memory**: Compressed summaries in Azure Cosmos DB

**Exercise:** Design a memory architecture for your specific use case (e.g., code review bot, documentation assistant, data analyst) (10 min)

**Production Considerations:**
- Security: Authentication, authorization, audit logging
- Scale: Horizontal scaling, caching, rate limiting
- Cost: Token budgets, pruning strategies, smart retrieval
- Future: MCP on Windows, expanding platform support

**Key Takeaways:**
- Memory architectures mirror human cognition patterns
- Vector search enables semantic understanding at scale
- Multi-agent systems require shared context coordination
- Production MCP requires security, monitoring, and cost optimization
