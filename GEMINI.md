# Gemini Code Assistant Guide

This document provides guidance for using Gemini Code Assistant with the `context-engineering` repository. This repository is the central hub for the O'Reilly Live Learning course, "Context Engineering with MCP".

## Project Overview

This repository contains all the course materials, including slides, labs, and reference implementations for the "Context Engineering with Model Context Protocol (MCP)" course. It's designed to be a hands-on learning environment for understanding and implementing persistent memory and tool-calling capabilities for AI models.

The primary technologies used are:

*   **Node.js, TypeScript, and Python**: For the MCP server implementations.
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: The core protocol for communication between AI models and external tools/memory.
*   **Azure**: For cloud deployment examples.
*   **DeepSeek API**: For AI-powered enrichment of memory entries.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four main segments, as detailed in `instructor/course-plan-jan-2026.md`:

1.  **Understanding Context**: Covers the fundamentals of AI memory and context windows.
2.  **Building Local MCP Servers**: Hands-on labs to build your first MCP servers.
3.  **Azure Deployment**: Deploying MCP servers to a cloud environment.
4.  **Advanced Patterns**: Explores multi-agent memory architectures and other advanced topics.

## Key Projects and Learning Resources

*   `mcp-servers/coretext-mcp`: A JavaScript-based MCP server that serves as the primary teaching example. It implements CRUD operations for a memory store and includes AI enrichment features.
*   `mcp-servers/stoic-mcp`: A more advanced TypeScript-based MCP server with a local and Azure workspace.
*   `mcp-servers/context_journal_mcp_local`: A Python-based MCP server.
*   `labs/lab-01-hello-mcp`: A hands-on lab for students to build their first MCP server.
*   `instructor/`: Contains the course plan, slides, and other materials for instructors.
*   `docs/`: Contains student-facing documentation, including setup guides and FAQs.

## Building and Running

### `coretext-mcp` (JavaScript)

This is the main teaching example.

*   **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    cd mcp-servers/coretext-mcp
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
*   **Run in development mode (with auto-reload)**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
*   **Test with MCP Inspector**:
    ```bash
    npm run inspector
    ```
*   **Run the test client**:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

### `stoic-mcp` (TypeScript)

This is a more advanced example using TypeScript and monorepo workspaces.

*   **Build the server**:
    ```bash
    cd mcp-servers/stoic-mcp
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
*   **Run the local server**:
    ```bash
    cd mcp-servers/stoic-mcp/local
    npm start
    ```

### `context_journal_mcp_local` (Python)

*   **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    cd mcp-servers/context_journal_mcp_local
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python context_journal_mcp.py
    ```

## Development Conventions

*   **Coding Style**:
    *   JavaScript/TypeScript: 2-space indentation, ES modules.
    *   Python: 4-space indentation.
*   **Naming Conventions**:
    *   Follow existing patterns, e.g., `src/index.js`, `src/index.ts`.
    *   Documentation files are often in `UPPER_SNAKE.md` format.
*   **Logging**: Use `console.error()` for logging in MCP servers, as `stdout` is reserved for the MCP protocol.
*   **Testing**:
    *   The `coretext-mcp` server has an automated test client (`npm test`).
    *   Other servers can be tested manually with the MCP Inspector (`npm run inspector`).
*   **Commits**: Use short, imperative, sentence-case commit messages.
*   **Security**: Do not commit secrets. Use `.env.example` files as templates and create `.env` files locally.
