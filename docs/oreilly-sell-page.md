## Course Outcomes

- Master MCP + Azure for persistent AI memory--build the same context systems used by Anthropic and Microsoft in production.
- Transform your GitHub repos into long-term memory for Claude, Copilot, and ChatGPT.
- Watch live MCP deployments in Azure, integrated with VS Code for seamless context persistence.
- Solutions are demonstrated in Azure but apply to all cloud services, including AWS and Google.

You mastered prompting—now stop your AI from forgetting everything. This hands-on course teaches you Context Engineering using MCP—the production-ready protocol adopted by Microsoft and Anthropic. You'll build persistent AI memory using MCP servers, Azure AI Service, GitHub, and VS Code, eliminating tedious context resets forever.

Leave with working code, templates, and the exact memory patterns the leading companies use today.

## What You'll Learn and How You Can Apply It

- Deploy MCP servers on Azure, connecting Claude, Copilot, and ChatGPT directly to your GitHub repos and databases.
- Enable your AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) to access long-term GitHub memory.
- Implement enterprise-grade memory systems (episodic, semantic) that scale
- Design multi-agent workflows leveraging MCP for seamless context sharing across tools.
- - Implement real-world MCP solutions, exactly how Anthropic and Microsoft operate in production today.

## This Live Event Is for You Because

- You're a developer, AI practitioner, or data engineer who already uses ChatGPT, Claude, or GitHub Copilot.
- You need your AI tools to retain context reliably across sessions and workflows.
- You're seeking practical, Azure-integrated solutions for context persistence, compatible with your daily VS Code/GitHub workflow.
- You want to master MCP early to lead adoption in your enterprise.

## Prerequisites

- **Active AI tool usage** - Current experience with ChatGPT Plus/Team, Claude Pro, or GitHub Copilot
- **GitHub proficiency** - Comfortable with repos, commits, and basic Git workflows (we'll use GitHub as context storage)
- **Azure familiarity** - Basic understanding of Azure services or willingness to create free account (for deploying MCP servers)

## Course Setup

- GitHub account with ability to create repos and personal access tokens
- ChatGPT Plus or Team for plugin/action capabilities
- GitHub Copilot active subscription in VS Code
- Claude Pro account - Gets MCP features built-in. Available on Windows and Mac.
- VS Code - Free, available on Windows and Mac
- Course Repository: [github.com/timothywarner-org/context-engineering](https://github.com/timothywarner-org/context-engineering)
